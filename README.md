This repository demonstrates a common but often difficult-to-diagnose bug in Firebase: errors caused by malformed or corrupted data received from the server.  The `bug.js` file shows how such errors can manifest, often with unclear error messages. The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, uses structured error handling and data validation to improve resilience and provide more informative error reporting.
